Here's what Imagine Surrey members and neighbours are up to this month.

## Near you

Town hall meetings are coming to every town centre. Check the events page for dates: {{site_url}}/events

## The promise tracker

We score every campaign promise against the public record. See what's kept, partly kept or broken: {{site_url}}/tracker

## Bring a neighbour

Most people join because someone they know asked. Your personal link credits you when a friend signs up: {{referral_link}}

Thanks for being part of this.
